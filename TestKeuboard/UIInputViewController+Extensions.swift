     Remove all subviews then add a `SwiftUI` view that pins
     to the edges and resizes the extension to fit the view.
     
     When this function is called, the input vc will convert
     its `keyboardContext` to an `ObservableKeyboardContext`
     and provide it to the view as an `@EnvironmentObject`.
     
     It will also provide the `SystemKeyboardStyle.standard`
     style to the view as an `@EnvironmentObject`, to ensure
     that a standard system keyboard style is defined if you
     want to create system keyboards. You can change this by
     just injecting another style after this has been done.
